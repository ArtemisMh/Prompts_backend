# LLM-Based Agentic Architectural Framework Prompts

This repository contains the prompt definitions used for the three LLM-based agents within the proposed agentic architectural framework guided by Knowledge Components (KCs) and the SOLO taxonomy.

📘 Overview

The framework introduces an agentic architecture composed of three specialized LLM-based agents. Each agent performs a distinct function within the learning design, analysis, and reflection processes, all of which are aligned with the hierarchical structure of the SOLO taxonomy to promote higher-order cognitive engagement.
